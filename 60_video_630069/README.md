### 00:00

In this section of the course we’ll look at the functional structure of Google Cloud.

### 00:05

Google Cloud’s resource hierarchy contains four levels, and starting from the bottom up they are: resources, projects, folders, and an organization node.

### 00:17

At the first level are resources.

### 00:20

These represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud.

### 00:29

Resources are organized into projects, which sit on the second level.

### 00:34

Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders.

### 00:37

These sit at the third level.

### 00:40

And then at the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization.

### 00:47

It’s important to understand this resource hierarchy because it directly relates to how policies are managed and applied when you use Google Cloud.

### 00:57

Policies can be defined at the project, folder, and organization node levels.

### 01:02

Some Google Cloud services allow policies to be applied to individual resources, too.

### 01:09

Policies are also inherited downward.

### 01:11

This means that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder.

### 01:17

Let’s take a look at the second level of the resource hierarchy, projects, in a little more detail.

### 01:24

Projects are the basis for enabling and using Google Cloud services, like managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and enabling other Google services.

### 01:36

Each project is a separate entity under the organization node, and each resource belongs to exactly one project.

### 01:44

Projects can have different owners and users because they’re billed and managed separately.

### 01:49

Each Google Cloud project has three identifying attributes: a project ID, a project name, and a project number.

### 01:57

The project ID is a globally unique identifier assigned by Google that can’t be changed after creation.

### 02:04

They’re what we refer to as being immutable.

### 02:08

Project IDs are used in different contexts to inform Google Cloud of the exact project to work with.

### 02:15

Project names, however, are user-created.

### 02:17

They don’t have to be unique and they can be changed at any time, so they are not immutable.

### 02:23

Google Cloud also assigns each project a unique project number.

### 02:27

It’s helpful to know that these Google-generated numbers exist, but we won’t explore them much in this course.

### 02:32

They’re mainly used internally by Google Cloud to keep track of resources.

### 02:38

Google Cloud’s Resource Manager tool is designed to programmatically help you manage projects.

### 02:43

It’s an API that can gather a list of all the projects associated with an account, create new projects, update existing projects, and delete projects.

### 02:53

It can even recover projects that were previously deleted,and can be accessed through the RPC API and the REST API.

### 03:02

The third level of the Google Cloud resource hierarchy is folders.

### 03:06

Folders let you assign policies to resources at a level of granularity you choose.

### 03:11

The resources in a folder inherit policies and permissions assigned to that folder.

### 03:16

A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both.

### 03:22

You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy.

### 03:26

For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set Google Cloud resources.

### 03:33

Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis.

### 03:38

Folders also give teams the ability to delegate administrative rights so that they can work independently.

### 03:44

As previously mentioned, the resources in a folder inherit policies and permissions from that folder.

### 03:51

For example, if you have two different projects that are administered by the same team, you can put policies into a common folder so they have the same permissions.

### 04:01

Doing it the other way--putting duplicate copies of those policies on both projects–could be tedious and error-prone.

### 04:08

if you needed to change permissions on both resources, you would now have to do that in two places instead of just one.

### 04:15

To use folders, you must have an organization node, which is the very topmost resource in the Google Cloud hierarchy.

### 04:21

Everything else attached to that account goes under this node, which includes folders, projects, and other resources.

### 04:30

There are some special roles associated with this top-level organization node.

### 04:34

For example, you can designate an organization policy administrator so that only people with privilege can change policies.

### 04:43

You can also assign a project creator role, which is a great way to control who can create projects and, therefore, who can spend money.

### 04:51

How a new organization node is created depends on whether your company is also a Google Workspace customer.

### 04:56

If you have a Workspace domain, Google Cloud projects will automatically belong to your organization node.

### 05:03

Otherwise, you can use Cloud Identity, Google’s identity, access, application, and endpoint management platform, to generate one.

### 05:11

Once created, a new organization node will let anyone in the domain create projects and billing accounts, just as they could before.

### 05:20

folders underneath it and put projects into it.

### 05:23

Both folders and projects are considered to be “children” of the organization node.
